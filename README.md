thx.core
========

Generic multi-purpose library. `thx.core` aims to be the [loadash](http://lodash.com/) library for Haxe.

It contains a lot of usefult helper classes to simplify dealing with a lot of types from the standard library.

It also provides new common types that should probably be part of the standard library: [Error](src/thx/core/Error.hx), [Nil](src/thx/core/Nil.hx), [Set](src/thx/core/Set.hx) and [Tuple](src/thx/core/Tuple.hx).
