Generic multi-purpose library. `thx.core` aims to be the [lodash](http://lodash.com/) library for Haxe.

## helper classes

It contains a lot of useful helper classes to simplify dealing with a lot of types from the standard library.

## new basic types

It also provides new common types that should probably be part of the standard library: [Error](src/thx/core/Error.hx), [Nil](src/thx/core/Nil.hx), [Set](src/thx/core/Set.hx) and [Tuple](src/thx/core/Tuple.hx).

## macro helpers

`thx.core` also includes a few helpers to more easily write and deal with macros.
